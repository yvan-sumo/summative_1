    "For this summative assignment, we ask you to find a dataset from an internet source of choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general assessment criteria for all summative assignments are mentioned in the assignment description on Canvas. Each notebook also has a few specific criteria we look for; make sure you fulfil them in your approach to this assignment.\n",
    "In general, make sure this notebook represents a complete project: Write an explanation of what you are hoping to achieve with your analysis, document your code well, and present results in a comprehensive way.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assessment Criteria\n",
    " - A suitable dataset for regression is selected, and a reasonable argument is made for why regularization is expected to be valuable for its analysis.\n",
    " - A regularization and a model-selection method (e.g., Ridge, Lasso, or Elastic Net) is correctly implemented, including hyperparameter tuning and a baseline comparison.\n",
    " - Appropriate performance metrics and visualizations (e.g., coefficient paths, error plots) are provided and interpreted clearly.\n",
    " - The notebook contains thoughtful reflection on the models performances, discussing limitations, bias-variance trade-offs, or improvements over a baseline approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should choose a dataset for which you have no prior knowledge of the underlying data generating process (i.e. if you're an expert in election, do not pick an elections dataset -- aim to learn something totally new). Ensure the dataset is moderately sized, but has a very large number of features, such that multicollinearity is likely present and regularisation is necessary.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using BOTH model regularisation and model selection, show how penalised regression models can be used to learn about the distribution of the effect of useful features, and generate accurate predictions for the target of interest. "

    "Two datasets are included, related to red and white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal. The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests (see [Cortez et al., 2009], http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/wine/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese \"Vinho Verde\" wine. For more details, consult: http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/ or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009].  Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks.  The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods."
